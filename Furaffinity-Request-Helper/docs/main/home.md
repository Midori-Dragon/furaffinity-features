# General Information

This library provides basic functions for making http requests to Furaffinity, so you don't have to make, manage and handle those by yourself.
Most important request will simply be made by calling a function. This library currently doesn't support all request but aims to include them at somepoint.

## Bugs and Missing Features

This library is by any means not finished and will receive further developement. So if you find any Bugs please submit a new [Issue](https://github.com/Midori-Dragon/Furaffinty-Request-Helper/issues/new)
If you would like to have some Request added feel free to also submit an [Issue](https://github.com/Midori-Dragon/Furaffinty-Request-Helper/issues/new) and tell me what you want.
